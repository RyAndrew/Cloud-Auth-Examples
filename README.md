# Cloud-Auth-Examples

This is a PHP example using the Jumbojett\OpenIDConnectClient library to login to a php session using office 365 and okta

The github example is broken because github does not use OIDC but rather uses OATH2 - fixing that is for the future

To install go to the authlib dir and run composer install to grab all the dependencies
